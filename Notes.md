* what is docker?
  * It manages the application by containerizing it
  * each container has its dependencies bundled wih it and hence it is independent of the other container in the docker. Picture of a docker ship with huge container fits the definition.
  * containers can be run on any system which has the docker running without worrying about the environment docker is installed.
